## Usage

To use the picker do the following:

### Import header

```` objective-c
#import <WPMediaPicker/WPMediaPickerViewController.h>
````

### Create and present WPMediaPickerViewController

```` objective
WPMediaPickerViewController * mediaPicker = [[WPMediaPickerViewController alloc] init];
mediaPicker.delegate = self;
[self presentViewController:mediaPicker animated:YES completion:nil];
````

### Implement didFinishPickingAssets delegate

The delegate is responsible for dismissing the picker when the operation completes. To dismiss the picker, call the [dismissViewControllerAnimated:completion:](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/UIViewController_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/UIViewController/dismissViewControllerAnimated:completion:) method of the presenting controller responsible for displaying `WPMediaPickerController` object. Please refer to the demo app.

```` objective-c
- (void)mediaPickerController:(WPMediaPickerViewController *)picker didFinishPickingAssets:(NSArray *)assets
{
  [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil];  
  // assets contains ALAsset objects.
}
````
